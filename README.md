# ReCell
Project: Analyze the used devices dataset, build a model which will help develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identify factors that significantly influence the price.

# Skills and Tools Covered
EDA, linear regression, linear regression assumptions, business insights and recommendations, multicollinearity evaluation, p-value evaluation, VIF evaluation

# My Learnings
The skills used to complete this project included exploratory data analysis, data manipulation, missing value imputation and feature data engineering. In addition, essential processes were taken to build a regression model that best fit the data at hand. Some of these processes included removing features that showed signs of high multicollinearity or had little to no significance in calculating the target variable. Ultimately, valuable insights were given in regard to features that contributed the most and least to our target variable and what actions the client can take to enhance their business.
